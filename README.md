<h1 align="center">GLSL Blob Downloader</h1>
<p align="center">For a personal project, I needed to generate multiple images with abstract geometry on the background</p>
<br/>
<h2>GLSL Shader</h2>
<p>Although the shader is not mine, it's modified by me for the conditions of this project (<a href="https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise">original shader</a>).
<br/><br/>
The shader uses Perlin noise to modify the vertexes of the geometry, then using linear interpolation two colors are mixed.
<br/><br/>
All the WebGL is simplified by using the Three Js library.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>Once the blob was working I needed an interface to make it easier to change the settings and download the blob.
<br/><br/>
The website has a Neo Brutalism style made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it's pretty intuitive to use.</p>
